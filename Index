        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
            Access to safe, reliable, and affordable transportation remains a persistent challenge in Lesotho, 
            especially in urban centers like Maseru and remote rural areas. Public transport options are often 
            inconsistent, informal, and lack digital integration, leaving passengers with limited choices and 
            unpredictable travel experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Catch-a-Ride is designed to transform how people move around Lesotho. We offer a dependable, 
            transparent, and user-friendly ride-hailing service that not only addresses transportation inefficiencies 
            but also creates new economic opportunities for drivers and small fleet owners.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our commitment is to the Basotho communities — providing a service that prioritizes safety, 
            convenience, and affordability, while also contributing to a more sustainable urban environment.
